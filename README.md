OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT :LINEAR REGRESSION ON HOUSING PRICES

Key Objective:
The primary objective of the Linear Regression on Housing Prices project is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates house prices based on various features (e.g., average income, house age, number of rooms, and population in the area). This model aims to assist stakeholders, such as real estate professionals and buyers, in making informed decisions by understanding the relationships between these features and housing prices.

Goals:
Analyze the dataset: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key factors influencing housing prices.
Build a regression model: Use linear regression to capture the relationships between the features and house prices.
Evaluate the model: Assess model performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
Make predictions: Use the model to predict house prices for new or unseen data.
Provide insights: Identify the key factors driving house prices and their relative impact.

Key Insights:
Feature Correlations:

The heatmap of correlations between features shows how strongly each feature is related to house prices. Features like Avg. Area Income, Avg. Area Number of Rooms, and Area Population might exhibit a strong positive correlation with house prices, indicating their importance in predicting the price.
Regression Coefficients:

The coefficients obtained from the linear regression model provide insights into the impact of each feature on house prices. For example:
A positive coefficient for Avg. Area Income indicates that higher incomes in the area are associated with higher house prices.
The coefficient for Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms may be smaller or less significant, suggesting it has a weaker effect compared to other features.
Model Fit:

The scatter plot of actual vs. predicted prices shows that predictions closely follow a linear pattern, indicating a well-fitted model.
A histogram of residuals (differences between actual and predicted prices) reveals a bell-shaped, normal distribution, confirming that the model's errors are unbiased and well-distributed.
Performance Metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Indicates the average error in price prediction in absolute terms (e.g., dollars).
Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Highlight the variance in errors, with RMSE providing a more interpretable error scale in the same unit as the target variable (Price).
These metrics collectively show that the model performs well but may still have room for improvement if non-linear relationships or additional features exist.
Key Predictors:

Features like Avg. Area Income and Avg. Area Number of Rooms are likely to have higher coefficients, suggesting they are the strongest predictors of house prices in this dataset.
Other features like Avg. Area House Age and Area Population might have moderate contributions, with some variability depending on the dataset.
Model Assumptions:

The normal distribution of residuals and the linear relationship in the scatter plot validate the key assumptions of linear regression, such as linearity, homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), and normality of residuals.
